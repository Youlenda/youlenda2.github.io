As a dedicated educator, my teaching journey goes beyond the formal classroom. I've volunteered and worked as a self-employed tutor in various subjects, including Neural Networks, Electronics, Logic Circuits, Computer Architecture, and Mathematics. These tutoring experiences both fullfilled my passioan for teaching and deepened my understanding of these subjects.
