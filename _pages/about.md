I am currently a Ph.D. student at the GrUVi lab at Simon Fraser University (SFU), where I am supervised by Andrea Tagliasacchi. I completed my bachelor's degree at Amirkabir University of Technology and my master's degree at the University of Tehran, both in Electrical Engineering.

My research focuses on 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, particularly in the fields of computer vision and deep learning. Recent advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting have made it possible to create highly realistic 3D models and novel viewpoints from limited data. I am especially interested in refining these techniques and applying them to real-world scenarios.

Notable projects to which I have contributed or led:

* Evaluating Alternatives to SFM Point Cloud Initialization for Gaussian Splatting
* TensoRF Re-implementation
* Base Layer Efficiency in Scalable Human-Machine Coding
* Rate-Distortion Theory in Coding for Machines and its Applications
* VVC+M: Plug and Play Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines
* Control of Computer Pointer Using Hand Gesture Recognition in Motion Pictures

Outside the lab, I enjoy a variety of hobbies to maintain a balanced lifestyle. I regularly work out at the gym and have a keen interest in jigsaw puzzles and board games. I also enjoy watching crime movies and series; they are some of my favorite ways to detach from boredom.
